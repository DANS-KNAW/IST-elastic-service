# TODOS
- Proper validation for any payloads
    - Should implement class validation.

- Mapping option for alias/indice creation.
    - Since most datasets contain nested values it would be great if types could be properly set. We could simply allow the payload to contain a mapping structure that matches the interface of the Elastic Search SDK.

### Nice to haves
- Swagger docs instances
    - Not sure how usefull but might be nice to have a page were you can see the payload properties and response bodies.
